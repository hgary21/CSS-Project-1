				Bloom is a post processing effect that blurs bright parts of the HDR render to achieve a glowing visual
				effect.
				This allows objects brighter than the traditional brightest color, <em>RGB 255 255 255</em>, to appear
				even
				brighter by
				affecting neighboring pixels. This effect is usually implemented with a <em>Gaussian Blur</em> after a
				luminosity threshold step.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is difficult to apply bloom during the main rendering process because the <em>Gaussian Blur</em>
				layers
				require access to neighboring pixel's information, which might not be immediately available. Hence,
				bloom is
				most often implemented as a post processing effect, meaning it is applied after the majority of the
				render is
				completed. While post processing effects cannot directly read critical data about the scene and
				material, they
				can still use the depth buffer and other intermediate rendering passes which provide sufficent
				information to
				efficently calculate or approximate many photorealistic effects like bloom.
